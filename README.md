# picrust2-benchmark
Benchmarking PICRUSt2 functional inference on Mendes et al. (2017) soil microbiome dataset (PRJEB14409) against shotgun metagenomes (soil_LWM) as described in Sun et al. 2020. Includes full reproducible workflow in QIIME2 + PICRUSt2, sample alias mapping, and Spearman/Jaccard benchmarking pipeline with visual and presentation outputs.

# Mendes16S‚ÄìPICRUSt2 Benchmark

**Benchmarking PICRUSt2 functional inference on Mendes et al. (2017) soil microbiome dataset (PRJEB14409) against shotgun metagenomes (soil_LWM), following the benchmark by Sun et al. (2020).**

This repository reproduces the comparison between 16S-based functional inference (PICRUSt2) and shotgun KO abundances using the Mendes soil dataset.  
All steps are reproducible ‚Äî from QIIME2 preprocessing, PICRUSt2 predictions, to KO-level benchmarking and visualization.

## üß™ Pipeline Summary

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ 16S Data Processing (QIIME2)

Performed as **single-end** (forward reads only) due to limited overlap in 2√ó150 V4 reads.  
No demultiplexing required ‚Äî samples are already split.

**Commands:** [`qiime2/commands.sh`](qiime2/commands.sh)

Steps:
1. Import with `PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33V2`
2. Trim forward primer (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA)
3. DADA2 denoise-single
4. Export representative sequences and feature table

Outputs:
